This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.
